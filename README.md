# MIRAGE GAME ENGINE

## ENGINE TASKS

- [x] Setup renderer
- [ ] Refactor subsystems - make architecture more consistent
  - [ ] Experiment with using polymorphism
- [ ] Misc. utilities
  - [x] Common structs
  - [ ] Math utilities
  - [ ] Debugging utilities (logging)
  - [x] Smart pointer utilities
    - [ ] Investigate not using smart pointers for engine stuff since it's usually simpler
  - [ ] Profiling/Performance
  - [x] Traps
- [ ] Re-organize folder structure in engine
- [x] Implement renderer
  - [x] Make renderer more accessible from game
- [x] Model loading
  - [x] Separate model class
- [x] Proper rendering w/ transforms
  - [x] Move transform setting code into model code
  - [x] Camera class  
- [x] Specify initial state (Reference Oasis game engine?)
  - [x] Remove polymorphism from Application class?
- [x] Remove two project setup (too many headaches)
- [ ] Quaternions (yay!)

## GAME TASKS

- [x] Terrain setup
  - [ ] Properly orient terrain + allow multiple terrain pieces
- [ ] Character in game
  - [ ] Character controller (movement)
- [ ] Entity system

## ART TASKS

- [ ] Concept explorations
- [ ] Digital painted splash art
- [ ] Learn 3d modelling
  - [ ] Character model
  - [ ] Tree model

## GENERAL TASKS

- [ ] General game design
