# MIRAGE GAME ENGINE

## ENGINE TASKS

- [x] Setup renderer
- [ ] Misc. utilities
  - [x] Common structs
  - [ ] Math utilities
  - [ ] Debugging utilities (logging)
  - [x] Smart pointer utilities
    - [x] Investigate not using smart pointers for engine stuff since it's usually simpler
  - [ ] Profiling/Performance
  - [x] Traps
- [ ] Re-organize folder structure in engine
- [x] Implement renderer
  - [x] Make renderer more accessible from game
- [x] Model loading
  - [x] Separate model class
  - [x] Model textures
- [x] Proper rendering w/ transforms
  - [x] Move transform setting code into model code
  - [x] Camera class  
- [x] Specify initial state (Reference Oasis game engine?)
  - [x] Remove polymorphism from Application class?
- [x] Remove two project setup (too many headaches)
- [ ] Quaternions (yay!)

  - [ ] Terrain manager
  - [ ] Move to better folder location - graphicsUtils/graphicsToolbox
- [ ] Character in game
  - [x] Character controller (movement)
  - [x] Character controller (camera rotation)
  - [x] Camera rotation in up/down axis as well
  - [ ] Character moves with terrain (not necessarily physics based)
- [ ] Entity system

## ART TASKS
