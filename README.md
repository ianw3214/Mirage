# MIRAGE GAME ENGINE

## ENGINE TASKS

- [x] Setup renderer
- [ ] Refactor subsystems - make architecture more consistent
  - [ ] Experiment with using polymorphism
- [ ] Misc. utilities
  - [x] Common structs
  - [ ] Math utilities
  - [ ] Debugging utilities (logging)

    - [ ] Investigate not using smart pointers for engine stuff since it's usually simpler
  - [ ] Profiling/Performance
  - [x] Traps
- [ ] Re-organize folder structure in engine
- [x] Implement renderer

  - [x] Move transform setting code into model code
  - [x] Camera class  
- [x] Specify initial state (Reference Oasis game engine?)
  - [x] Remove polymorphism from Application class?
- [x] Remove two project setup (too many headaches)
